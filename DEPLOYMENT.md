## Known Issues (V1)

   - Validate file types server-side
   - Implement file size limits on server

3. **Security Headers** (Already added in vercel.json)
   - X-Content-Type-Options
   - X-Frame-Options
   - X-XSS-Protection

4. **Authentication**
   - JWT tokens
   - Session management
   - Password hashing (if passwords added)

5. **File Upload Security**
   - Server-side file validation
   - Virus scanning
   - File type restrictions
